            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I graduated highschool in June of 2021 with a GPA of ~3.7. 
                After taking a gap year off and exploring myself more I found a deep interest in coding. 
                From there I looked into career paths and landed on Software Engineering because the idea of developing applications and parts of larger platforms sounds extremely fun. 
                Outside of coding I am a computer geek, I have built my own computer and use it everyday from connecting with friends and family to countless hours of gaming with friends. 
                Another hobby of mine is drumming, all through school I was part of any school drumline I was even the center snare of my highschool drumline my senior year
